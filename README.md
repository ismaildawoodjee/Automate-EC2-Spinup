# Bash Scripts to Automatically Spin Up an EC2 Instance

The main motivation of this mini-project was to practice my Bash scripting
skills and get familiar with using the AWS CLI to automate tasks on the command
line. This particular repo has a setup script to automatically spin up an EC2
instance, SSH into it, install dependencies, and host a simple Flask app using
the image pulled from Docker Hub.
